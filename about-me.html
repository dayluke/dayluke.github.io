        <section class="about_me_description">

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have been programming for <strong>over 5 years</strong>, having started by programming small
                <strong>mobile apps</strong> when I was 15 years old. Realising the extent of my capabilties,
                I decided to publish my first mobile app, <a href="golf-pads.html">Golf Pads</a>. It came to be
                my spotlight portfolio piece at the time, securing me an unconditional place at
                <strong>Falmouth University</strong>. At Falmouth, I studied <strong>BSc(Hons) Computing for
                Games</strong>, where my passion for game development continued to blossom. I gained the
                experience of working in a <strong>multidisciplinary team within a studio environment</strong> and 
                explored many fields and areas within computer science, such as artificial intelligence, distributed 
                systems, cyber security - the list goes on. Throughout my time at Falmouth, I took the role of 
                <strong>Lead Programmer</strong> in all of my group development projects and games, to exercise
                my leadership and management skills. My teams had the pleasure of publically releasing our games onto
                <strong>Steam</strong>, where they are available to download and play, such as <a href="carma.html">Carma</a> 
                which has over <strong>500 players</strong>. All of the projects and games that I have produced have been made in 
                <strong>Unity</strong>, using <strong>C#</strong>. In my free time, and through personal projects, I have 
                experimented with other programming languages, such as <strong>JavaScript, Python and HTML & CSS</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for programming, and more specifically game development, sprouted from my <strong>love for video games</strong>.
                From a young age, I would always watch my brother and dad play on the Xbox classic. I grew up playing games 
                like Simpsons Hit & Run, Tomb Raider, Star Wars Battlefront, and Halo. It's no surprise that once I started gaming 
                on a computer that I found a love for Minecraft and Assassins Creed. In recent years, my  go-to games have been 
                Overwatch, Fortnite and GTA V. Besides gaming, I really enjoy <strong>reading manga, and watching anime</strong>. 
                I also find joy in keeping my skills fine-tuned with <strong>hackathons and game jams</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Achievements and Awards</h2>
            <p>
                Other than my impressive experience, I have accomplished many achievements and awards throughout my life. 
                I have a <strong>full UK drivers license</strong>, which has been kept clean since I obtained it.
                Upon reaching university, I became a <strong>Student Mentor</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Student Partner</strong>, 
                and was certified in <strong>Azure Fundamentals</strong>. Furthermore, I have an <strong>Enhanced DBS</strong>, 
                which was needed when I was a tutor.
